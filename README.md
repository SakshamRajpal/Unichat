Excited to share my latest Project "Unichat", a better Facebook Messenger alternative, using the power of Firebase, stream Chat services, and React.js. 📱💬

⚡ Features:-
🔐Firebase Authentication: 
-Implementing secure user sign-in and sign-up flows using third-party providers like Google and Facebook.
-Managing user sessions and authentication state(authState) to handle protected routes.
📱Stream Chat API:
-Utilizing the Stream services for real-time messaging.
-Handling Stream Chat SDK to connect users, manage channels, and retrieve messages.
📲React.js for Frontend Development:
-Fully responsive layout for optimal use on all devices using React.js.
-Handling React Router for navigation between chat rooms
📊Real-Time Data Management:
-Using Firebase's real-time database or Firestore for managing live user data.
-Synchronizing real-time updates like message status and read receipts using both Firebase and Stream

Although, this was a smaller project compared to previous one still I want to share some important things that i have learned while making this project:-
✔️Along with Firebase & stream Chat, i have also use "Facebookfordevelopers" so that Firebase can also provide authentication through Facebook login.
✔️If you are using "Google" for login, then Firebase is the easiest and the best way for providing authentication as it is developed by Google Only.
✔️Instead of "Stream Chat", you can also use "LiveChat" or "SendBird".
✔️Along with common react Hooks like "useState","useSelect" i have also uses "useContext","useNavigate" for managing navigation flow and handling user interaction.
✔️This was my second time using "Firebase", but i also found "Stream Chat" services a developer friendly software for providing Chat services.

You can view the project code at my github link:-🔗https://lnkd.in/gwXazVMj

Generally, I use github for deployment but this time i have use "Netlify" deployment services:-
